# Dagger 2 Tutorial
This is a tutorial repository that provides a simplified explanation of how to use Dagger 2, a dependency injection framework for Java.

Why Dagger 2?
Dagger 2 is a popular dependency injection framework that offers several benefits, including:

Reduced boilerplate code: Dagger 2 automatically generates code to handle dependency injection, eliminating the need for manual wiring of dependencies.
Improved code modularity: Dagger 2 encourages a modular approach to code organization, making it easier to test and maintain large codebases.
Compile-time dependency checking: Dagger 2 performs dependency checks at compile time, preventing runtime errors caused by missing or misconfigured dependencies.
